# solar system simulation
A basic planetary motion simulation running in your browser, visualization using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and data from NASA. 
I'll try to implement Runger Kutta fourth Order, Leapfrog, Verlet and Heun's integration to see the difference in accuracy it makes. 
The vector class is a modified version of [evanw's vector.js](https://evanw.github.io/lightgl.js/docs/vector.html)
